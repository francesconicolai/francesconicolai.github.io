## Working Papers
### [An Impossibility Theorem for Price-Based Risk Constraints](https://francesconicolai.github.io/papers/CCP_impossibility.pdf)

<div style="text-align: justify">
Price-based constraints map sampled transaction prices into a risk statistic and then into a binding requirement, such as posted margin, a haircut, a leverage limit, or a mandated portfolio reallocation. We prove a constructive local impossibility theorem: no price-based, risk-sensitive rule can jointly achieve three desirable properties, namely (i) risk sensitivity, (ii) liquidity continuity, and (iii) round-trip manipulation-proofness, in any reachable binding state in which amplification is sufficiently strong. The proof constructs a rule-induced trigger-and-reverse deviation: an arbitrarily small trade tilts the sampled statistic, tightens a binding requirement at first order, induces predictable forced liquidation, and is profitably reversed. Unlike classic manipulation that relies on large trades to move the price level, the incentive here runs through first-order effects of sampled prints on the rulebook and the resulting forced flow; it does not require large trades or large price moves, and it does not rely on making a slack constraint bind. The result holds with continuous trading between discrete measurement and reset times, and it survives strategic responses by constrained traders. Vulnerability is state dependent: marginal sensitivity is highest when realized risk is low, so tranquil states can be most exposed to manipulation. Quantitative relevance is summarized by a local amplification factor, the product of pass-through elasticities along the loop from prices to the statistic, to margin requirements, to forced sales, and back to prices via impact. With portfolio margining and cross-impact, trigger and liquidation directions can differ, generating cross-contract manipulation and spillovers. The design implication is immediate: implementability requires limiting short-horizon pass-through, rationalizing anti-procyclicality tools such as smoothing and state-contingent buffers.

### [Dynamic Arbitrage from Price-Based Risk Constraints](https://francesconicolai.github.io/papers)

(with [Simona Risteska](https://risteskasimona.github.io)) 
<div style="text-align: justify">
Price-based risk constraints map sampled transaction prices into binding margin, haircuts, leverage limits, or target-volatility reallocations. This feedback creates dynamic arbitrage even when the underlying impact model is manipulation-proof in the classical sense. A trader can execute a trigger-and-reverse round trip: trade inside the sampling window to tilt the statistic, force mechanical trading, then unwind into predictable flow. We characterize the optimal attack under both single-asset marking and portfolio marking; under portfolio marking, the problem reduces to a two-portfolio attack strategy. We derive an admissibility test that, given market-impact estimates, yields a liquidity-scaled bound on the maximum size of the constrained sector that regulators can use to limit its scale. Applied to volatility-managed portfolios, realistic inputs imply a maximum scale around 0.4 daily volume. Risk becomes endogenously manipulable, a related but distinct instability mechanism from leverage-cycle models and the paradox of financial stability.</div>

### [Biased Beliefs and Institutional Overcrowding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5024961)

Understanding the determinants of overcrowding behaviour is challenging due to the difficulty in measuring investor beliefs and preferences. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring the dynamics of investor behaviour within the leveraged loan market. Our major findings reveal that overcrowding among institutional investors in this market is driven by incorrect beliefs about their peers’ actions rather than unobservable asset characteristics or positive spillovers across investors. Using a structural model of entry, along with exclusion restrictions and instrumental variables, we assess the accuracy of investor beliefs regarding their peers’ investment decisions. Our findings refute the hypothesis of unbiased beliefs, indicating that overcrowding is driven by investors’ incorrect assumptions about peer behaviour. Additionally, we recover the out-of-equilibrium beliefs of investors, providing insights into the determinants of their investment choices. These insights have significant implications for understanding market dynamics and quantifying the effect of overcrowding on asset prices.</div>

### __[Revealed Expectations and Learning Biases: Evidence from the Mutual Fund Industry](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3301279)__

<div style="text-align: justify">
By inverting the optimal portfolios of mutual fund managers in a fairly general setting, which allows us to partial out the effect of risk aversion and hedging demands, we provide an estimate of perceived expected excess returns and show that they are significantly affected by experienced returns. The effect of past returns is non-monotone: we provide reduced-form and structural evidence of managers displaying recency and primacy bias. Finally, we estimate an average coefficient of relative risk aversion close to unity.</div>

### [Job Market Paper: Contagion in The Market for Leveraged Loans](https://francesconicolai.github.io/papers/JMP.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify">
Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) spread shocks in the market for leveraged loans. I document that, in order to satisfy constraints based on the par value of their assets, CLOs become forced sellers of high quality securities when hit by negative shocks to otherwise unrelated securities. Loans sold for non fundamental reasons trade at depressed prices for up to nine months after the shock. The effect cannot be explained by selection on ex-ante or ex-post loan characteristics. A large fraction of the dislocation in secondary markets is transmitted to the market of issuance: shocked companies due to refinance their loans substitute away from institutional tranches towards other types of securities. The substitution is imperfect causing an increase in the cost of borrowing.</div>

## Work in Progress
### [Living on the Edge: the Salience of Property Taxes in the UK Housing Market](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3381519)

(with [Marco Pelosi](https://marcopelosi.github.io/) and [Simona Risteska](https://risteskasimona.github.io)) 
<div style="text-align: justify">
Taxes that happen concurrently with the purchase are more salient than deferred taxes. Using a sharp geographical discontinuity between London Boroughs, we show that the incidence of property taxes deferred to the future is too small compared to the incidence of stamp duty taxes happening at the moment of buying the property. The difference in incidence implies very large discount rates that cannot be easily rationalized even after accounting for liquidity constraints. The lack of salience at the moment of purchase implies that the burden of the tax will be borne in the future to meet the budget constraint. This implies that there is an optimal tax mix, even though one of the two taxes is more distortionary than the other.</div>
